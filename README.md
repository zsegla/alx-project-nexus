## Project Objective

This repository documents major learnings from the ProDev Frontend Engineering program. It serves as a knowledge hub, showcasing understanding of frontend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices acquired throughout the program.

### Objectives

- Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Frontend Engineering program.
- Document major frontend technologies, concepts, challenges, and solutions.
- Serve as a reference guide for both current and future learners.
- Foster collaboration between frontend and backend learners.

## Overview of the ProDev Backend Engineering Program

The ProDev Backend Engineering program focuses on building robust, scalable, and secure backend systems. It covers:

- API design and development
- Database management
- Authentication and authorization
- System architecture
- Integration with frontend applications

Collaboration between frontend and backend learners is encouraged to simulate real-world development environments.

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed superset of JavaScript for scalable applications.
- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs and runtime for fulfilling those queries.
- **API Integration**: Connecting frontend applications to backend services.
- **System Design & Analysis**: Planning and structuring scalable, maintainable systems.
- **Mobile Development**: Building responsive and performant mobile web apps.
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**: Enhancing web apps with offline capabilities and native-like features.

### Important Frontend Development Concepts

- Component-based architecture
- State management
- Responsive design
- Accessibility (a11y)
- Performance optimization
- Testing and debugging

## Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

- **API Integration Issues**: Solved by using tools like Postman for testing and improving error handling in code.
- **Styling Consistency**: Addressed with TailwindCSS and design systems.
- **Type Safety**: Leveraged TypeScript to catch errors early and improve code quality.
- **Collaboration Barriers**: Used Discord and GitHub for effective communication and version control.
- **System Scalability**: Applied system design principles to ensure maintainability and performance.

---

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- Write clean, maintainable code with clear documentation.
- Use version control (Git/GitHub) for all projects.
- Communicate regularly with team members.
- Test early and often.
- Stay updated with industry trends and tools.
- Embrace feedback and continuous learning.

---

## Collaboration Hub
