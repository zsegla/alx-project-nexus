# E-Commerce Product Catalog

This is a full-stack e-commerce product catalog web application. Users can browse products, filter by categories, and sign in/out. The app is built for speed, scalability, and modern UI/UX.

## 🌟 Project Motivation

Online shopping is now a daily part of life. This project aims to demonstrate how to build a modern, scalable, and user-friendly product catalog for e-commerce, using cutting-edge web technologies. The goal is to provide a seamless experience for users and a robust foundation for developers.

## 👩‍💻 User Experience

- Instantly browse a wide range of products
- Filter products by category, price, and other attributes
- View product details in a clean, responsive layout
- Sign in and out with a single click (anonymous authentication)
- Enjoy fast page loads and smooth interactions

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture, separating frontend and backend concerns for maintainability and scalability.

- **Frontend:** React (with Vite), TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Convex (serverless database and functions), Chef (Convex frontend framework)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: Component-based UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language for safer, scalable code
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid and consistent styling
- **Convex**: Serverless backend for real-time data and authentication
- **Chef**: Framework for connecting Convex backend to React frontend

## 🗄️ Backend Details

- Product data is stored in Convex, allowing for real-time updates and scalability
- Backend functions handle product queries, filtering, and authentication
- Schema is defined in TypeScript for type safety and validation

## 🎨 Frontend Details

- Product cards display images, names, prices, and details
- Catalog view supports filtering and searching
- Responsive design ensures usability on mobile and desktop
- Authentication state is managed with Convex Auth

## 🔐 Authentication
